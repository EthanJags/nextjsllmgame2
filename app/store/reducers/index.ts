// // purpose of this file is to combine all reducers into one object, and export that object. This is a common pattern in Redux applications, and is a good practice to follow.
// import { combineReducers } from "redux";
// import language from "./language";
// // import player from "./player";
// import player from "../slices/playerSlice";
// import socket from "./socket";
// import room from "./room";

// export default combineReducers({
//   language,
//   player,
//   socket,
//   room,
// });
